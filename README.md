# Mathematical and Data Modelling 1 (MDM1) - Report 2

## Optimising the Connections of Telecommunication Networks

MDM1 is a module unique to my course Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol. It focuses on applying mathematics and data modelling in the modern world, individually and in groups. This was my first group project.

### Goal
We were organised into random groups and assigned with this prompt:

> A telephone company has the major hub in a particular town and additional hubs in N other villages. All additional hubs need to be connected with the main hub either directly or through other hubs. Propose at least two methods/algorithms to connect all additional hubs to the major hub and determine the one that minimises the total length of cable. How do the performances of the methods depend on the number and the position of the hubs?

The goals of this report were to:
- Determine suitable methods/algorithms to minimise connection between hubs.
- Explain and demonstrate the aforementioned methods with a real world example.
- Analyse the methods and identify the most appropriate algorithm.

### Target Audience
The report should be accessible to a scientifically literate person with no particular expertise in the topic which we discuss.

### Report and Feedback
The report can be found [here](MDM1%20REP2.pdf) and the feedback we recieved can be found [here](MDM1%20REP2%20Feedback.pdf)
